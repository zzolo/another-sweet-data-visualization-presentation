            * It's charts, graphs, maps, and many other design techniques.

            * In my opinion it comes down to a few things: <br>
            * Well, there are computers.  Lots of them. <br>
            * Specificially, our computers can visualize things much easier as they become more powerful. <br>
            * Designers and artists use computers more easily. <br>
            * The internet, its prevelance and increased bandwidth, has allowed us to see (good) data visualization often. <br>
            * And I am a firm believer that the success of open source software and mentality has allowed many people to build amazing things inexpensively and collaboratively, especially on the web.

            * Hopefully you can come up with the idea you want to communicate and get the most approriate data. <br>

            * When it comes to crime, its really hard to choose one metric that can describe how crime is behaving <br>
            * Ultimately we want to show the idea of safety. <br>
            * This is tough, let alone with the little data we had. <br>
            * We try to show a current snapshot of crime <br>
            * The idea of safety includes comparison, both historically, but also to neighboring areas.<br>
            * That is why all these are the same size (except population) <br>
            * We combine some categories to help pear down the categories while still knowing that not all crime is equal. <br>
            * We try to show the long term trend.  But we also want to take into account the seasonal difference of crime (higher crimes in the summer), hence why we choose this metric. <br>
            * Colors are automatically assigned through a version of k-means clustering <br>
